# Getting started with Node.JS

1.  Install `nvm`, a Node JS version manager.

    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash

1.  Install current `lts` version of node, by typing `nvm install --lts`
2.  List the current version with `nvm ls`
3.  Verify that `npm` is installed as well --> `npm --version`
4.  To change the current Node install, `nvm use --lts` to switch to current version. Change accordingly to the version you need.

## For VS code

Add the `node.js extension pack` plugin
